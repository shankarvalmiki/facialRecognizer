hey guys,
this is a simple facial recognition application for office,college or school attendance system 

To run this application you have to pip install the following modules:-
pip install cmake 
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
pip install opencv-python
these are the main modules you need to install and the dlib will be installed when you install face_recognition module
but its better to install it before installing face_recognnition

also you need to have visual studio build tools for c++
and if you face any problem while running the application regarding installing face_recognition_modules
then try "pip install setuptools"

you might still face problems if your setuptools are not upgraded so just upgrade the setuptools module and you will be good to go.
